# **Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Forecasting**

This project focuses on predicting electric vehicle (EV) charging station demand using time-series analysis. By analyzing historical data from EV usage, weather and traffic patterns, it enables smarter planning of charging infrastructure and more efficient energy distribution. The final output includes predictive models and interactive dashboards to support decision-making.

## **Project Goal**

To accurately forecast EV charging demand by analyzing historical usage, weather variations and traffic patternsâ€”and to visualize these insights in a way that helps stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions.

## **Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Programming:** Python, Microsoft Excel
* **Key Libraries:** Pandas, Prophet, ARIMA, Matplotlib
* **Data Visualization:** Tableau (for dashboards, trend analysis and heatmaps)
* **Deployment Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook (Python-based development), Streamlit, Tableau Public

## **Project Workflow**

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

* Combined datasets from EV charging logs, weather history and traffic records.
* Cleaned and standardized the data, resolving missing values and normalizing demand values for consistency.

### 2. **Time-Series Forecasting**

* Used both Prophet and ARIMA models to project future charging demand.
* Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to choose the most reliable forecast.

### 3. **Visualization & Insights**

* Built interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize demand trends across years, time periods and under varying weather conditions.
* Designed heatmaps to highlight high-demand time slots and identify peak usage patterns.

### 4. **Optimization Strategy**

* Proposed charging schedule adjustments to shift usage away from peak demand hours.
* Suggested a demand-responsive approach to resource allocation, helping reduce grid pressure and improve energy efficiency.
